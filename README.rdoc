= FpActsAsMoney
This exists only because i wish to silence some errors while using giant crufty old rails 2.x models in a one-off rails 3 app
That used a non compatable acts_as_money plugin. 

This gem is basically that plugin in gem form and really introduces no new features that rails 3 does not already provide better. 

Expect this project to die at any moment.
